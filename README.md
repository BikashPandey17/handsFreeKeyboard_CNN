# handsFreeKeyboard_CNN
Deep learning project on CNN Hand gesture classification.

Proposed Title of the Project(By Guide) - Communication System for audibly Disabled people

# Introduction 

## Background

As a subfield of Deep learning, the field of computer vision has undergone tremendous research through the ages. Gesture recognition is one
such topic that falls under computer vision that allows users to control and interact with any device without actually touching them.
We attempt at providing an efficient hand gesture recognition system where the users can tweak the real time processing according to their environment and use it accordingly.
This project focuses on implementing a real time application that recognizes 48 different gesture inputs which include English Alphabets(A
-Z), Numbers(0-9) and special characters like(',', space, new line,... etc) which inturn aids in the communication of people who are
audibly or vocally impaired acting as the medium of translation. Moreover the application also allows people to continously use it as a
real time keyboard without actual "Keys". Frankly the technology has vast areas of application which includes Gaming, Security, Medicine
etc but we can focus on only one now!
Given the fact we wrote a software driven only by mathematical algorithms without using any external devices like kinect depth camera etc
(except obviously a Camera) reduces the cost drastically and helps the application to reach a greater demographic.
